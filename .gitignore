# ====== ROS2 FOLDERS ======
# Ignore contents of ROS2_bag (raw data), keep folder

# Ignore ROS2_stream subfolders (raw sensor outputs), keep folders
ROS2/ROS2_stream/gps/*

ROS2/ROS2_stream/images/*
!ROS2/ROS2_stream/images/.gitkeep

# ====== FILE TYPES TO IGNORE ONLY IN DATA FOLDERS ======
# If you want, can ignore mcap, msg, bin, png inside ROS2_bag or ROS2_stream, 
# but not globally, to avoid blocking important project files
# This is already covered by ignoring contents of folders above
